# CS-439
This repository consists project implementation for [**EPFL CS-439**](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/optimization-for-machine-learning-CS-439) course.

# Introduction
In the folder ```scripts``` you can find all the code for the implemetation of the **ExtraAdam** and [**Lookahead**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08610.pdf) algorithms. In the folder ```extra_var_reduction``` you can find implementation of the [**Extragradient with Variance Reduction (EGVR)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08352.pdf) algorithm (with some our modifications, for more details look into report).

**`TeamMembers`**: **Denys Pushkin**, **Yaroslav Kivva**, **Zhecho Mitev**

# Quickstart
To reproduce our results you should open the ```main.ipynb``` notebook from the root of the repository and follow the instructions inside notebook.

_Remark: All the models was trained with GPUs on Colab and it takes approx 1-2 hours for each experiment! If you run it with CPU it could take a lot of time to fit the models properly._
